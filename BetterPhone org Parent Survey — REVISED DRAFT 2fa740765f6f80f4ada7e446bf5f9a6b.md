# BetterPhone.org Parent Survey — REVISED DRAFT

**Intro:**

Help Us Build a Better Phone for Kids

We're a group of parents and child development researchers working to create a phone that puts children's development and well-being first — one that thoughtfully accounts for technology's real impact on children's minds. Please take a few minutes to share your experiences so we can build something that truly serves families.

**Pain Check (Required to continue)**

Before we continue, we need to make sure this survey is right for you:

*Is your child's relationship with their phone/device causing you significant stress or concern on an at least daily/weekly basis?*

○ Yes, this is a regular source of stress and problems in our family
○ Sometimes
○ No

*[If "Not really" → Thank you screen + email signup only][If "Yes" or "Sometimes" → Continue]*

**Step 1: Tell us what's going on (Voice)**

Hit record and share:

What is the most challenging aspect of your child's relationship with screens or technology? Please share all the painful parts openly and honestly — feel free to just brain dump everything you feel. We are here to listen without judgment.

*Helper text: Talk about how it feels, specific moments, what's happening day-to-day. Whatever comes to mind. This part is open-ended as we want to hear what comes to mind for you first.*

**Step 4: Can you elaborate on why those were the most painful problems for you (or go a little bit more in depth on those in general for us). Also how urgent would you say solving these problems are for you. (Voice answer)**
